Device Provisioning hierarchy
=============================

Service		net.connman.iwd
Interface	net.connman.iwd.DeviceProvisioning [Experimental]
Object path	/net/connman/iwd/{phy0,phy1,...}/{1,2,...}

Methods		string StartEnrollee()

			Start a DPP enrollee. Currently only station devices are
			supported.

			Returns the enrollees URI

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.InvalidArguments
						net.connman.iwd.AlreadyExists
						net.connman.iwd.NotAvailable

		void Stop()

			Stop an enrollee.

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.Busy
						net.connman.iwd.Failed
						net.connman.iwd.InvalidArguments

		string StartConfigurator()

			Start a DPP configurator. Currently only connected
			station devices are supported, and will only configure
			the enrollee to the currently connected network.

			Returns the configurator URI

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.NotAvailable
						net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
						net.connman.iwd.NotConfigured
						net.connman.iwd.NotSupported
						net.connman.iwd.Busy

		string ConfigureEnrollee(string uri)

			Start a DPP configurator with an enrollees URI.
			Only connected station devices are supported and will
			only configure the enrollee to the currently connected
			network.

			This API is to handle the use case where the enrollee
			has shared its URI to IWD (unlike StartConfigurator)

			The URI for IWD is also returned which could be used
			in the same way as it is with StartConfigurator().

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.NotAvailable
						net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
						net.connman.iwd.NotConfigured
						net.connman.iwd.NotSupported
						net.connman.iwd.Busy

		PkexConfigure(dict args)
			The 'args' dictionary (a{sv}) contains parameters for
			the PKEX configurer. This can be empty or contain the
			following dictionary members:

			string Key - The PKEX key. This is required if not
			specified in the network profile already.

			string Identifier - The PKEX key identifier. This is
			optional, but if used both the Configurer and enrollee
			must use the same value. Can also be specified in the
			network profile.

			uint32_t Timeout - A timeout (in seconds) for
			configuration. This is optional, but suggested to
			prevent a device from indefinitely configuring
			enrollees (if Stop() was never called).

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.Busy
						net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
						net.connman.iwd.InvalidArguments
						net.connman.iwd.NotConfigured

		PkexEnroll(dict args)
			The 'args' dictionary (a{sv}) contains parameters for
			the PKEX enrollee.

			string Key - The PKEX key. This is required and must
			match the configurer's key.

			string Identifier - The PKEX key identifier. This is
			optional, but if used both the Configurer and enrollee
			must use the same value.

			array(y) Address - The address of the PKEX listener. If
			not specified a broadcast address is used.

			array(u) Frequencies - A list of frequencies to
			discover on. If not specified channel 2, 44, and 149
			are used per the DPP spec.

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.Busy
						net.connman.iwd.InvalidArguments

Properties	boolean Started [readonly]

			True if DPP is currently active.

		string Role [readonly, optional]

			Indicates the DPP role. Possible values are "enrollee"
			or "configurator". This property is only available when
			Started is true.

		string URI [readonly, optional]

			Indicates the DPP URI. This property is only available
			when Started is true.
